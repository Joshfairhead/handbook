# F.A.Q.s

## Can I become who I want to be?

You are already who you are. Please question what aspects of your past have shaped the image  of who you would like to be instead of yourself. With that informed 

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
