# Hack-along

## What's an Hack-along?

An hack-along is prescriptively non-prescriptive, so it is quite difficult to give a straight answer to that question. There is common list of patters that people use while doing them, so we can list a few here for you to pick up and use.

Every location running an hack-along chooses which patterns to adopt, or can propose new ones, as long as they aid people to co-live, co-create, and collaborate!

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
