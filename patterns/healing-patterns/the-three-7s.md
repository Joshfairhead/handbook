# The three 7s

This exercise is meant to apply gratitude and forgiveness and positive reinforcement to oneself.

Write down 7 things you are proud of yourself, 7 things you forgive yourself for and 7 things you commit yourself to.

Speak them to yourself \(eg: while looking at the mirror\) once a day.  
Adjust sentences as required.  
Repeat for a month, or for as long as deemed useful.
